            I enjoy playing games, from tabletop rpgs to board games, TRS to RTS, 4x space to 1st person shooters. I currently am working on a game in unreal engine 5, when I have the free time I like to work on it.

            There are a few projects I would like to do, things like build a augmented reality visor. 
            By using the bendable phone screen from a razor or a Z-flip, and replace them with the lenses in sunglasses. 
            Then have 3 micro cameras on the frame to overlay the surroundings onto the screen. 
            We can then use the hand motion software that surgeons utilize for robotic surgeries to recognize hand position and motion as a user interface. 
            Then install blue tooth capabilities so that your mobile deice can mirror to your visual display. 
            Probably better to run a cable like a walkman and a head set, that would solve the power issue regarding longevity.

            My connection to God and Jesus is important to me. I was disconnected for a long time. The renewal of my faith has saved my marriage and me, while gracing  us with a son. through God, all things are possible.
